# Python:
Python is used to handle requests to the mySQL database 'moviesDB' via mod-wsgi. for more info, you can reference the documenation here: https://github.com/Nate-NAI/wsgi-python

# HTML/CSS/JS:
Inside the HTML files, Ajax calls are made to create HTTP requests with APACHE routes to app.py 
The CSS/JS used can be found here: https://bootstrapmade.com/nice-admin-bootstrap-admin-html-template/

Static file routing is handled in the APACHE config file, see the wsgi-python repo (linked above) for detailed information.
